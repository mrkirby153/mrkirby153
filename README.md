### Hi there I'm Austin ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a fourth year computer science student (graduating Spring 2021) who's done extensive work with Java and Kotlin over the last 7 years.

The main projects that I've been working on are [KirBot](https://kirbot.mrkirby153.com), a modular and highly configurable Discord moderation bot and [Giveaways](https://giveaways.mrkirby153.com), a battle tested giveaway discord bot capable of handling giveaways with hundreds of thousands of entrants.

Additionally, I've worked on some other small projects, such as [bug-free-spork](https://github.com/mrkirby153/bug-free-spork), an Eloquent inspired ORM for Java and Kotlin
